# Structures
- `http/`:
    - Currently, Zig doesn't have any Open API Generator tools, so I have to use the http client in neovim ([kulala.nvim](https://github.com/mistweaverco/kulala.nvim)) to setup for API testing.
- `sql/`: contains schema, seed for database.
- `src`: contains the main source code.
